		Amid Immigration Crisis, GEO Group and Biden’s DOJ Prevail in Overturning California’s Ban of For-Profit Private Immigrant Detention Prisons
	</h1>

	<h2>By Alex O'Connor <br>Oct. 15, 2021</h2>

<p class="opening">On October 5, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that a California state law phasing out private detention prisons by 2028 is unconstitutional and constitutes an infringement on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration. The 2-1 split decision reversed a district court ruling in October 2020 that upheld the law. Known as AB 32 or People Not Profit, it is the first statewide effort to ban private prisons by prohibiting private companies from opening new facilities in the state, or extending or renewing existing contracts.</p>
<p class="opening">After the bill was signed into law by Governor Newsom in October 2019, both GEO Group Inc. and former President Trump’s Department of Justice sued the state of California. GEO Group is the private prison conglomerate which owns and operates five of the state’s six private immigration facilities. However, the Biden Administration decided to continue its legal challenge alongside GEO Group despite calls from immigrants’ rights <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/12/groups-urge-doj-withdraw-suit-against-california#">activists</a> and <a href="https://torres.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-torres-grijalva-urge-doj-drop-lawsuit-benefitting-profit-prison">lawmakers</a> urging the Department of Justice to drop its case.</p>
<p class="opening">The California Department of Justice, headed by Attorney General Rob Bonta, defended People Not Profit on the argument that it has the duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all within its borders, thereby granting the state the authority to outlaw private facilities which fail to provide even the most basic levels of care to individuals in their custody.</p>

			<h1 class="subhead">Medical Neglect and Covid-19 </h1>
				<p>Since 2005, the highest number of deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody was recorded in 2020 with 21 deaths. More than a third of those who died tested positive for Covid-19. An investigation by the <i>New York Times</i> found that ICE detention centers had an infection rate 20 times greater than that of the general population. Advocates say the failures of ICE and its contractors to adhere to the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social isolation, personal protective equipment and sanitation are to blame for these preventable deaths and for the inhumane conditions inside the prisons. A 2019 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general concluded the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino, California provided “inadequate detainee medical care.”</p>

		<h1 class="subhead">$1-per-day “Work” Program</h1>
			<p>Detained migrants’ only opportunity to generate an income is to resort to what advocates call economic exploitation in the form of GEO Group’s “volunteer” work program. They were often tasked with the same duties employees on pay-roll are assigned to like cooking, cleaning and doing laundry, yet these immigrants earn only $1 per day for their labor. GEO Group and other operators of for-profit detention facilities have engaged in this scheme since at least 2014 when detainees at an Aurora, Colorado detention center first sued GEO Group over the controversial program. They did not prevail in their case, but a current class action lawsuit before the federal district court in Washington is challenging the same program on the grounds that it violates the states’ minimum wage laws and the plaintiffs are seeking back pay.</p>

	<h1 class="subhead">Exposure to Toxic Pesticide</h1>
	<p>In March, after a seven-month investigation in response to complaints from detainees that a substance they were supplied to clean with was causing illness, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a <a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/final_inspection_report_1.pdf">report</a> and <a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/now_geo_final_1.pdf">official warning</a> to GEO Group for misuse of the toxic pesticide, HDQ Neutral, in Adelanto ICE Processing Center. Ingredients found in the pesticide have been linked to asthma, infertility, birth defects, other respiratory and reproductive harms and even damage to human DNA. The EPA said GEO was not diluting HDQ Neutral properly and exposing detained migrants to a mixture that was twice as concentrated as the label permits. The report found GEO responsible for violating six different provisions of the pesticide label for HDQ Neutral, which was applied several times a day over a nine-year period, amounting to an unquantifiable number of violations and affected persons.</p>

	<h1 class="subhead">Astronomical Bond Amounts</h1>
	<p>Most detained immigrants are simply incarcerated while waiting for a decision on their immigration case to be made - they have not committed any crimes. Unlike criminal bonds where a bondsman will ask for around 10% of the bail before posting bail on behalf of the defendant, the payer of an immigration bond must make the payment in full and only in cash equivalent methods. Because ICE can refuse an immigration bond for any reason and bondsmen might consider immigration bonds flight risks, bonds people often do not want to take on this risk, whether real or perceived. In 2014, advocates from the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity working with families impacted by Adelanto detention center were seeing bonds around $1,000 - $3,000. In more recent years, they began seeing bonds skyrocket to $10,000, $30,000 and $40,000.</p>

	Now, AG Bonta must determine whether to appeal the circuit court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the 9th Circuit to review the decision “en banc,” where the case is reheard by the Chief Justice and ten other judges. Furthermore, the 9th Circuit’s decision remanded the case back to the district court and is understood by legal experts to mean the law is likely to be enjoined while litigation continues.
